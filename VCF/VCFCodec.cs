	/// A feature codec for the VCF 4 specification
	/// 
	/// <p>
	/// VCF is a text file format (most likely stored in a compressed manner). It contains meta-information lines, a
	/// header line, and then data lines each containing information about a position in the genome.
	/// </p>
	/// <p>One of the main uses of next-generation sequencing is to discover variation amongst large populations
	/// of related samples. Recently the format for storing next-generation read alignments has been
	/// standardised by the SAM/BAM file format specification. This has significantly improved the
	/// interoperability of next-generation tools for alignment, visualisation, and variant calling.
	/// We propose the Variant Call Format (VCF) as a standarised format for storing the most prevalent
	/// types of sequence variation, including SNPs, indels and larger structural variants, together
	/// with rich annotations. VCF is usually stored in a compressed manner and can be indexed for
	/// fast data retrieval of variants from a range of positions on the reference genome.
	/// The format was developed for the 1000 Genomes Project, and has also been adopted by other projects
	/// such as UK10K, dbSNP, or the NHLBI Exome Project. VCFtools is a software suite that implements
	/// various utilities for processing VCF files, including validation, merging and comparing,
	/// and also provides a general Perl and Python API.
	/// The VCF specification and VCFtools are available from http://vcftools.sourceforge.net.</p>
